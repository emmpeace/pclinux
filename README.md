my journey from Windows to Linux

So this June 2025 and Windows 10 is coming to its end ... <br>
Like Pewdiepie, My 8 years desktop PC is going to Linux <br><br>

Problems I ran into:
1. Deactivate Bitlocker on my other disk

I had to deactivate bilocker
```
manage-bde -status
manage-bde D: off
```
   
2. EFI is full

I had to get into the bios and delete some secure boot keys that were taking a lot of space.<br>
